# Handwritten Digit Recognition and Object Detection
## Binary Class Detection using TensorFlow
In this project we train a TensorFlow CNN model on MNIST Hand written digits dataset to predict handwritten digits and also localize multiple classes in real time. 
The front-end is created using TKinter and inference on the model is also done using TKinter. You can view the demo of the Detector here: https://youtu.be/pe2mR4ijMoY
