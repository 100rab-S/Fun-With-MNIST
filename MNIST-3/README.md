# Handwritten Digit Recognition and Class Localization
## Multi Class Localization using Tensorflow
In this project we train a Tensorflow CNN model on MNIST Hand written digits dataset to predict handwritten digits and also localize the class in real time. 
The front-end is created using TKinter and inference on the model is also done using TKinter. You can view the demo of the Detector here: https://youtu.be/GqU7_CmDq40
