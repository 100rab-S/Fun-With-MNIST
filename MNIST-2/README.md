# Handwritten Digit Classification using MNIST Dataset
## Multi Label Classification
The project is to train a Deep Learning model to classify Handwritten digits as binary labels in the real world. The model is build using Tensorflow and inference on the model is done using TKinter.
You can view the demo of the project here: https://youtu.be/isx4xFyojqY

NOTE:
I have tried multiple approaches to tackle this problem (notebooks from V0 to V4), but couldn't improve training accuracy more than 75%. All though the model is performing pretty well in real time, which is demonstrated in the demo. Any improvements are highly appreciated.
