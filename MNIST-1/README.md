# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset.

## Multi-Class Classification
In this project we train a TensorFlow CNN model on MNIST Handwritten digits dataset to predict handwritten digits. The front-end is created using TKinter and inference on the model is also done using TKinter. You can view the demo of the Detector here: https://youtu.be/hGnWIepoJuw
