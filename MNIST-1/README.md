# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset.

## Multi-Class Classification
In this project we train a Tensorflow CNN model on MNIST Hand written digits dataset to predict handwritten digits. The front-end is created using TKinter and inference on the model is also done using TKinter. You can download the .exe file to run the detector on your machine. You can also view the demo of the Detector.
